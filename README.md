# 2DMemory
Simple card game developed using Unity3D and C#. The idea was taken from "Introduction to interactive programming using Python" cource on Courcera.
Some part of implementation was taken from "Unty in Action" by Joseph Hocking
Biuld 1.0 contains fully playable game with set of 14 cards.
In the plans: add some score mechanism, with local save; add random change of cards suit; change existing start screen - its soo vague :)
